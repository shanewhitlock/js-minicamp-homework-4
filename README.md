# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Callback Functions
	Callback functions are functions that are created outside of another function, but called within that other function.
	* Closure
	Closures are functions that use variables that are defined in the parent of another function by using that function as a callback. effectively getting into the scope of a previously defined function and getting the variables with the scope that they have in that previous function.
	* arguments array
	the arguments array is an object that is on any function. that would include any parameters that are passed into a function.
	* recursion
	recursion is using a function to call back upon itself.
	* prototype
	Prototype is a method that you can put on a constructor or a class that allows you to use that method on any object of that same class. this makes it so you don't have to create the method on every single object.
	* constructors
	constructors are methods that define a particular type of object that allows you to easily create multiple objects and give values to previously defined attributes of that object.

2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
